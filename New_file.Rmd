## Rmarkdown exercise

#### Packages for Rmarkdown

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("tinytex")
tinytex::install_tinytex() # Tinytex is requred for PDF format
library(rmarkdown)
```
#### Create, list and extract directories and files

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dir.create("output") # Create directory
dir.create("./output/figures") 
unzip("all_data.zip") # Unzip ZIP file
list.files() # List files on current directory
list.dirs() # List directories on current directory
```

#### Import data and visualize data structure

I am familiar with these sort of commands and I use them often on my current PhD project. For this reason I do not go into detail.

```{r}
flowers <- read.table(file = "data/raw_data/flower.txt", sep = "\t", header = T, stringsAsFactors = T)
```


``summary()`` returns some measures of central tendency of the variables of the data set, whereas ``str()`` only returns the column names and their data type.


```{r}
str(flowers)
```
```{r}
summary(flowers)
```

#### Rmarkdown language

* ``< Ctr + Alt + I >`` opens a chunk of code
* ``echo = FALSE`` can be added next to the ``{r}`` at the chunks of code that do not need to be shown.
* ``eval = FALSE`` can be added next to the ``{r}`` at the chunks of code that do not need to be run at knitting.
* Introducing images: ``![image](path){width=???px, height=???px}``
